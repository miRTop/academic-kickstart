Bioinformatics oriented research on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and integrated data analysis. As part of Ph.D. developed user friendly tools for analyzing post-translational modifications of proteins and tools for integrated omics data analysis for genome refinement. I am keen to work in collaborations for enhancing my skills in data analysis and deploy tools to benifit scientific community.
